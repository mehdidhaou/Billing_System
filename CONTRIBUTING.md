## How to become a contributor and submit your own code

### Contributor License Agreements

We'd love to accept your patches! Before we can take them, we have to jump a couple of legal hurdles.

Please fill out either the individual or corporate Contributor License Agreement (CLA).

- If you are an individual writing original source code and you're sure you own the intellectual property, then you'll need to sign an individual CLA.
- If you work for a company that wants to allow you to contribute your work, then you'll need to sign acorporate CLA.

_**NOTE**_: Only original source code from you and other people that have signed the CLA can be accepted into the main repository.

### Contribution guidelines and standards

Before sending your pull request for [review](https://github.com/mehdidhaou/Billing_System/pulls), make sure your changes are consistent with the guidelines and follow the TensorFlow coding style.

#### General guidelines and philosophy for contribution

- Include unit tests when you contribute new features, as they help to a) prove that your code works correctly, and b) guard against future breaking changes to lower the maintenance cost.

- Bug fixes also generally require unit tests, because the presence of bugs usually indicates insufficient test coverage.

- When you contribute a new feature to Billing_System, the maintenance burden is (by default) transferred to the Billing_System team. This means that the benefit of the contribution must be compared against the cost of maintaining the feature.
